int i = 5;
int j = 6;
int k = 7;


if we want to store all the three into one variable then we can use Array:

int num[] = {5,6,7} ; // All we need to do is add an array symbol to indicate that we are storing the values in array.

- initializing dynamic array : 
    int num[] = new int[5];  --Array of size 5
